GoalieBot README:

This is a repository for the GoalieBot project for ECE470. The robot we plan to base our project off of is the UR3 used in the lab component of this course. 

So far, we have implemented a UR3 robot with a spherical object as a ball.

We can control the robot movements via Python implementation, and have incorporated a proximity sensor for detecting the presence of a ball. We can read the detection data with our python script as well to see if the robot sees the ball or not.
